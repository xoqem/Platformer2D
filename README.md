Platformer2D
============

The beginnings of a 2D platformer in LWJGL and Java.

I was experimenting with using LWJGL to create a 2D Platformer, though I ultimately decided I would use a slightly higher level engine if I decided to actually flesh out a fully operational 2D platormer engine at some point in the future.
